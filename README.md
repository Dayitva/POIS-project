# POIS Project

## Description
This project contains vulnerabilities and attacks shown in the paper "A Survey of Attacks on Ethereum Smart Contracts (SoK)". The code is written in Solidity. Most of the code is written in the latest version of Solidity (^0.8.0) but other versions have been used too in case the vulnerability only existed in the older version.

## File Structure
There are two main folders:
- `Vulnerabilities`: contains example contracts created by us that are vulnerable to differnet malicious attacks. 
- `Attacks`: contains specific contracts that contain the vulnerabilities shown before and can be attacked (through one or more ways).

The code has been tested and can be run on Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
